The console is a program that allows users to interact directly with the operating system via text commands. It is often referred to as the command line or terminal.

## Opening the console

- **Windows:**
  - Search for “Command Prompt” or “PowerShell” in the Start menu.
  - Alternatively: Press <Kbd windows="Win+R" />, type `cmd`, and press <Kbd windows="Enter" />.

- **macOS:**
  - Open “Applications” > ‘Utilities’ > “Terminal.”
  - Or use Spotlight (<Kbd windows="Cmd+Space" />) and enter “Terminal.”

- **Linux:**
  - Usually with <Kbd windows="Ctrl+Alt+T" />.
  - Or search for “Terminal” in the application menu.

## Using the console

1. **Input:** Type commands, e.g., ls (shows files) or cd folder name (changes the folder).

2. **Execute:** Press Enter to start the command.

3. **Navigation:**
   - Arrow keys: repeat previous commands.

   - Tab key: automatically complete file names.

   - Cancel: stops a running command.

   - Help: Many commands support the `--help` or `man` command to get more information.

## Why do you need the console?

The console allows you to control your computer directly using text commands. Many developer tools and tasks (e.g., software installation, version control, automation) are faster or only available via the command line.

## Origin of the console

The console is a so-called **command line interface (CLI)** and dates back to the early days of computer technology, when graphical user interfaces (GUIs) did not yet exist. It was operated exclusively via text commands. Even today, the CLI is an important tool for developers and system administrators.
