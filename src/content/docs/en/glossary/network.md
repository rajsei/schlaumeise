## Network

A **network** is a **group of at least two devices** that can exchange data. Networks can be wired (LAN) or wireless (WLAN). They are used to share resources such as files, printers, or Internet access.

## WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)

A **WLAN** is **a wireless network** that connects devices within a limited area (e.g., home, office, café). It enables communication and data transfer between devices without cables. WLAN can be operated with or without Internet access.

### Example of a WLAN network:

A computer and a printer are connected via **the same WLAN**. The computer can send commands to the printer to print documents without the need for a cable. The resulting network enables **communication between the devices** and ensures that they can exchange data. If the WLAN is connected to the internet, both devices can also use online services; without the internet, the connection only works locally.

## Hotspot

A **hotspot** is **a device or location** that **provides Wi-Fi** so that other devices can connect to it.

**With internet access:** Connected devices can access the internet.

**Without internet access:** The devices can only communicate with each other locally (e.g., exchange files, use printers), but cannot go online.

### Hotspot example:

A **smartphone provides a hotspot**, i.e., a Wi-Fi network that other devices can use. A **tablet connects** to this hotspot **to gain internet access via the cell phone's mobile network**. This allows the tablet to go online even when no regular Wi-Fi is available. Without internet access on the cell phone, the connection only works locally, e.g., for exchanging files between devices.

## Distinction:

**Network** is the general term for connected devices.

**Wi-Fi** is a wireless type of network.

**Hotspot** is a device or location that provides Wi-Fi, often with a focus on internet access.
