## Requirements

You will need a computer, a suitable SD card for your Raspberry Pi with the correct operating system installed
(see “Setting up the SD card”), and an internet connection. ...

## Installing BirdNET Pi

<Steps>

1. Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi.

2. Connect the Raspberry Pi to the power supply using the power adapter.
   An LED on the Raspberry Pi should light up or flash. It is best to wait a few minutes for it to boot up.

3. Open the console.

</Steps>

<div class="step-code">
  <LinkCard
    title="More information about the console"
    href="../../glossary/console/"
    description="Instructions for opening and operating the console."
  />
</div>

<Steps>
  4. Connect to the Pi using the following command. Use the data you entered
  previously. ...
</Steps>

<div class="step-code">

```sh
ssh birder@birdnetpi.local
```

<Code
  lang="plaintext"
  title="Terminal"
  class="terminal-code"
  code="PS C:\Users\Name> ssh birder@birdnetpi.local 
  The authenticity of host 'birdnetpi.local (2a02:4454:c122:2000:15gc:24b7:f06a:f322)' can't be established. 
  ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:kfRttaVIh+Z/FbSq9g6adalVfIsgvUtk4o. 
  This key is not known by any other names. 
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?"
/>

<Aside type="caution" title="Fehlerbehebung"> 
  <Accordion>
    <AccordionItem title="What if no connection can be established? (The specified host is unknown.)">

      If the following message appears:
      <Code
      lang="plaintext" title="Terminal" class="terminal-code"
      code="PS C:\Users\Name> ssh birder@birdnetpi.local
      ssh: Could not resolve hostname birdnetpi.local: The specified host is unknown."
      />
      this means that no connection can be established to your Raspberry Pi.

      Check the following points:
      <Steps>
        1. Power supply: Make sure that the Raspberry Pi is turned on, the SD card is inserted correctly,
        and the status LEDs are flashing or lit.
        2. Network: Make sure that your PC and Raspberry Pi are on the same network—i.e., connected to the same Wi-Fi or hotspot.
        (Make sure that the Wi-Fi data in the Raspberry Pi OS matches your current Wi-Fi.)
        3. Reinstallation: If the connection still fails, reinstall Raspberry Pi OS on the SD card
        and carefully re-enter the Wi-Fi access data.
        4. Direct connection: Experienced users can connect a keyboard and screen directly to the Raspberry Pi
        to manually check the connection and network settings.
      </Steps>

    <AccordionItem title="What if ‘WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!’ is displayed?">

      Don't worry—this is normal if you have previously connected to a
      Raspberry Pi with the same name via SSH. Here's how to fix the problem:

      <Steps>
        1. Open the file: C:\Users\username\.ssh\known_hosts (the exact path is also in the warning) with a text editor.

        2. Find all lines that start with birdnetpi.local and delete them.
        There may be several entries spanning multiple lines.

        3. If you have never used SSH for other connections, you can also delete the entire contents of the file. 4. Save the file, close the editor, and then try the connection again.

     </Steps>

5. Confirm the connection.

6. A password prompt should then appear.
   Enter the password stored in the operating system. Note that the password will remain invisible as you type it.
   If you are no longer prompted to enter a password, restart the process by entering the command from step 4.

<Steps>

7. This step is only for Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W:
   The RAM of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W is too small to install BirdNET-Pi without modification.
   Therefore, the so-called swap size must be increased. This ensures that, in addition to the physical hardware,
   part of the SD card is also used as RAM.
   Without this adjustment, BirdNET-Pi cannot be installed on the Zero 2 W.
   In addition, the Wi-Fi power options must be adjusted.

</Steps>
<div class="step-code">

```sh
sudo sed -i 's/CONF_SWAPSIZE=512/CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048/g' /etc/dphys-swapfile &&
sudo sed -i 's/#CONF_MAXSWAP=2048/CONF_MAXSWAP=4096/g' /etc/dphys-swapfile &&
sudo sed -i '/^exit 0/i sudo iw wlan0 set power_save off' /etc/rc.local
```

    To ensure that the changes have actually been applied, you can open the appropriate file with the following command.

    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
    ```
    It is important that the lines `CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048` and `CONF_MAXSWAP=4096` are correct. If not, adjust the numbers.

Now restart the Raspberry Pi.

```sh
sudo reboot
```

Then wait a few minutes until the system has fully booted up and connected to the Wi-Fi.
Then reconnect to the Pi via SSH (see steps 4 and 6).

8. Use this command to start the BirdNET-Pi installation.
   The process may take several minutes, depending on your internet connection and system performance.
   Leave the terminal open until the installation is complete.
