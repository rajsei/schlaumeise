Have you ever been curious about what's singing on your balcony or in your garden?
The listening birdhouse makes it possible! Inside is a small Raspberry Pi running BirdNET—an AI that recognizes bird songs. The system listens around the clock and will show you which species are chirping in your area.

## Prior knowledge

Basic computer skills are required; some English is helpful.
You can follow the instructions step by step even without in-depth technical knowledge – but it will be easier if you already have experience with consoles and basic programming.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us by email.

## Checklist: What do I need?

- A **Raspberry Pi**
  - **Raspberry Pi 5** ca. 55-140 € (2-16GB RAM)
  - **Raspberry 4B** ca. 40-80€ (1-8 GB RAM)
  - **Raspberry Pi 3B** ca. 40 €
  - **Raspberry Pi** W2 ca. 20 € - The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W is the least powerful model among the supported devices.
    If you choose this model, you should invest in a **high-performance SD card**, as a large part of the system load will be shifted to the card. In addition, not all BirdNET-Pi functions can be reliably executed on the Zero 2 W.
    To avoid crashes or limited responsiveness, it is recommended that you disable features such as live audio in BirdNET-Pi.

- **SD card** with at least 8 GB

- For the Raspberry Pi 5, Raspberry Pi 4B, and Raspberry Pi 3B+, a normal SD card is usually sufficient—for example, a Class 10 or UHS-I card with good read and write speeds. However, if you are using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, we recommend a high-quality SD card.
  With this model, a larger portion of the system load is outsourced to the SD card, so the performance and durability of the card are particularly important here.

* Possibly an **adapter** for microSD cards for your computer
* **Power supply** for your Raspberry Pi
* **USB microphone** or **USB sound card and AUX microphone**
* For the Raspberry Pi Zero W2, a **microUSB - OTG adapter** is also required
* If you do not want to set up the Pi via SSH, i.e., using your computer, or if you want to troubleshoot, the following may be useful:
  **Mini HDMI to HDMI adapter** to connect the Pi to a screen. **USB keyboard**—pay attention to which and how many USB ports your Pi has available.
