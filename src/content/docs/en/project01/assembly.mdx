How do I install the BirdNET Pi in my garden?

## Options

There are several ways to install the BirdNET Pi outdoors:

Birdhouse: You can install the Pi in a wooden birdhouse. Be aware that it is not weatherproof. Therefore, place it in a sheltered location and bring it indoors during heavy rain or frost.

Junction box: You can find junction boxes for electrical installations at DIY stores. These are ideal for protecting the Pi from the weather.

External microphone: You can also just put the microphone outside. This keeps the Pi dry and allows you to design the housing however you like.

3D printing: For a clean installation, 3D-printed brackets can be used to securely attach the Pi.
