## What role do birds play in nature?

Imagine a morning without birdsong—pretty quiet, right? Birds not only fascinate us with their songs, they also feature in myths and proverbs (think of the saying “The early bird catches the worm”). Above all, however, they are enormously important for ecosystems and the environment. Here are a few examples of the roles birds play in nature:

**Seed dispersal:** Many bird species ensure that plants spread. They transport seeds by eating fruit and excreting or hiding the indigestible seeds elsewhere. In this way, birds connect different habitats and help forests and meadows to grow. If an important bird species disappears, this “gardener” help is often lost – some plants would then hardly spread at all.

**Pollination of flowers:** Did you know that not only bees but also some birds pollinate flowers? In the tropics in particular, hummingbirds with their long beaks carry pollen from flower to flower. Plants and birds form a team: if the bird disappears, the flower can no longer reproduce – both are dependent on each other.

**Natural pest control:** Many birds are a gardener's best friends. They eat vast quantities of insects, spiders, and other creepy-crawlies. During the breeding season, a pair of blue tits brings hundreds of insects to their chicks every day – helping birds keep pests such as aphids and mosquitoes at bay. This means they help agriculture and our gardens without the use of chemicals.

**Bioindicators of the environment:** Birds often serve as nature's “thermometer” because they are vital indicators of the health of our environment. Since they live in almost all ecosystems and niches around the world, changes in their populations and distribution can signal far-reaching shifts in overall biodiversity. If certain bird species suddenly become rarer or disappear altogether in a forest, something is wrong there—the natural balance has been disturbed. Because many birds react very quickly to environmental changes, we can recognize early on whether an ecosystem is deteriorating or recovering. Bird protection is therefore also human protection, because what harms birds often points to problems that ultimately affect us all.

## Difference between songs and calls?

Birds use two types of sounds: calls and songs.

Calls are usually short, simple, and have a clear function – such as sounding the alarm, maintaining contact, or demanding food. They are used throughout the year.
Songs are longer, often complex sequences of notes. Usually only the males sing, especially during the breeding season, to mark their territory or attract a mate.

## Why do birds sing?

Acoustic communication plays a central role in biology. Calls and songs serve vital biological purposes. These include finding a mate (courtship songs), signaling danger (alarm calls), and coordinating group behavior (e.g., when searching for food).

The biological complexity is particularly evident in subtle differences:
• Dialects and call types: Many species have regional dialects, which makes identification difficult.
Examples include the well-known dialects of the yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) in Europe or the cryptic call types of the red crossbill, which can sometimes only be distinguished by their calls.
• Life stages: Even within the same species and location, it is possible to distinguish adults from young birds by their vocalizations.
